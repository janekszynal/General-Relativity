**Calculation of Christoffel Symbols:** 

This Notebook computes the **Christoffel Symbols** or affine connection from a given metric.
The user must input the covariant components of the metric tensor by editing the relevant input line in this Mathematica notebook.

All the components computed are in the coordinate basis in which the metric was specified. 
It works for all **finite dimensions**.
